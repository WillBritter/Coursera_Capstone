Predicting The Severity Of An Accident From Contextual Data


In this project I sought to find a way to predict the severity of an accident from contextual data such as road and weather conditions. This can 
be used to help inform drivers of the safety of a road trip and enable local emergency services to predict the conditions of people who are 
caught in accidents, which would enable emergency services to be better prepared to handle any injuries that are found.

Data is collected from public records of accidents in the form of csv files (the provided Data-Collisions.csv file, for example). This data 
records informaton such as the severity of accidents, such as the time, location and number of invovled parties to the collision. This data will 
be used to build and train a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict the severity of an accident.

To train the ML model to predict severity, we will use the data stored in only a subset of the columns in the file. This list consists of the 
JUNCTIONTYPE, INATTENTIONIND, UNDERINFL, WEATHER, ROADCOND, LIGHTCOND and SPEEDING columns, in addition to the counts of involved parties 
(vehicles and people). We will need to replace some of these with dummy variables, so that numeric data can be fed to the model. It will be 
assumed that any blank data is negative and so have a value of 0. Any responses that have a total occurrence less than 1000 are excluded as it is 
felt that this is insufficient data to properly model the impact of these conditions, with the exception of the counts of involved parties as 
these will have a direct impact on the potential severity of an accident. Where a response of Unknown or Other is recorded the response is dropped,
as these inputs will only serve to confuse the model. The data set has not been rebalanced with regards to the accident severity. This is because 
once all of the variable columns have been filtered and sorted out the remaining dataset is split approximately 2:1 between the severity 
demarcations. This should be sufficiently common to avoid biasing of the model through random sampling of the dataset in favour of one severity.
