Predicting The Severity Of An Accident From Contextual Data


In this project I sought to find a way to predict the severity of an accident from contextual data such as road and weather conditions. 
This can be used to help inform drivers of the safety of a road trip and enable local emergency services to predict the conditions of people who are caught in accidents,
which would enable emergency services to be better prepared to handle any injuries that are found.

Data is collected from public records of accidents in the form of csv files (the provided Data-Collisions.csv file, for example).
This data records informaton such as the severity of accidents, such as the time, location and number of invovled parties to the collision.
This data will be used to build and train a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict the severity of an accident.

We will need to replace some of these with dummy variables, so that numeric data can be fed to the model. 
It will be assumed that any blank data is negative and so have a value of 0.
Any responses that have a total occurrence less than 1000 is excluded as it is felt that this is insufficient data to properly model the impact of these variables on outcome.


To train the ML model to predict severity, we will use the data stored in only a subset of the columns in the file.
This list consists of the JUNCTIONTYPE, PERSONCOUNT, INATTENTIONIND, UNDERINFL,WEATHER, ROADCOND, LIGHTCOND and SPEEDING columns.
